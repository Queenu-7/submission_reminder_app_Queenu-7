This is a an app that shows and reminds students of their pending submissions.

Create environment.sh is setting up the directory structure for an application called submission reminder app. This script creates the necessary directories and files for a program that shows students who need to be reminded of their pending submissions

For the submissions.txt file is going  to contain the records of the studentâ€™s submission status.

The files config.env, reminder.sh, functions.sh, and startup.sh  are going to facilitate the functioning of the application.

For the copilot shell script.sh prompts the user for the assignment name that allows you enter the new assignment and enables the startup to show pending assignments for the updated assignment.

Startup.sh file is the one which runs the reminder.sh to show assignment history.

This is the structure of the app`s files and directories that help it work;

Submission_reminder_{yourName}/
|__app/
|   |___ reminder.sh
|___modules/
|   |___functions.sh
|___assets/
